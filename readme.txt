Allows a 16x16 icon to be displayed in a post or page using a shortcode.

== Description ==
Easily add an icon to a post or page using the [icon] shortcode.

For example, to display the note icon, shortcode usage is [icon=note]; 1,000 icons from the famfamfam Silk collection are included.

Defintion of icons can be found at famfamfam.com: http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/; a settings page also shows all available icons.

Adding any png file to the plugins /images folder will make them available from the shortcode; this allows the replacement of the included flags with alternatives if required.
